6. Finish your investigation with a short overview of your insights. 

     - What do you think the user was doing?
     -A user is downloading a Linux package from the website that is monitored
     - Was the file they downloaded malicious? If not, what is the file used for?
     - It is not for sure if it is malicious, in some cases it could be an update from a sysadmin and they are the ones creating the traffic. You would need more 
     information to figure if it is malicious.
     - Is there anything that seems suspicious about this activity? Not yet, without further investigation
     - Is any of the traffic you inspected potentially outside of compliance guidlines? Because it is a referral link from Facebook, it is most likely not in compliance to post updates from Facebook. This person could be further investigated in order to see if it is indeed suspicious activity
